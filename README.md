# Holiday Lighting for Hubitat

It's cool to use colored lights for holiday displays.  Surprisingly, there
are relatively few apps that allow scheduling different color palettes for
different holidays.

This app performs two related functions with a set of RGB lights:
- Because these lights are probably used for normal illumination, it provides
  a simple lighting-triggered-by-sensors option.
- On scheduled holidays, a holiday-themed set of colors is applied to the
  selected lights.
